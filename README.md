## 🔒 Security

This application implements Spring Security with JWT for authentication. The security flow works as follows:

1. User registers or logs in through authentication endpoints
2. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is issued
3. This token must be included in the Authorization header for subsequent requests
4. Protected endpoints verify the token before processing requests


## 📚 API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger. Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:

```
[http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html)
```
